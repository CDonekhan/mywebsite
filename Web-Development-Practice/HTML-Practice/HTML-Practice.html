           <p><span>html</span> stands for hypertext markup language. The hypertext refers to the hyperlinks that can be created to link different webpages. The markup section refers to the various tags used throughout the language.</p>
             <p> An example of a markup tag could be the simple <span>&lt;p&gt;</span> (paragraph) markup tag.</p>
            <pre>&lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
            <p>All markup tags follow the format of the opening-tag: <span>&lt;p&gt;</span> content: <span>Hello World</span> closing-tag: &lt;/p&gt;</p>
            <p><span>Attributes</span> are added to a tag to give it a particular property.</p>
            <p>An <span>&lt;a&gt;(anchor) tag</span> is used to create a link from text. The attribute <span>href=""</span> is added to specify the source of the link!</p>

          <h1>Webpage Structure</h1>
          <h2>General Page Layout</h2>
          <p>To begin a webpage a <span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span> is written to specify the <span>html type</span> of the page. The page is then wrapped in an <span>&lt;html&gt;</span> tag to display where the html content is.</p>
          <pre class="text-align-left">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
  &lt;html&gt;
    Rest of document bruh
  &lt;/html&gt;
          </pre>
          <p>The webpage is then sectioned into the <span>&lt;head&gt;</span> and the <span>&lt;body&gt;</span>. </p>
          <pre class="text-align-left">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
  &lt;html&gt;

    &lt;head&gt;
      Content of the head
    &lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;body&gt;
      content of the body
    &lt;/body&gt;

  &lt;/html&gt;
          </pre> 
          <h2>The Head</h2>
          <p>The <span>&lt;head&gt;</span> contains information that the webpage uses and references such as <span>&lt;style&gt;</span> tag for <span>css</span> files  and <span>&lt;script&gt;</span> tag for <span>java</span> files. We will focus only on the <span>css</span> for now! </p>
           
          <p><span>html</span> is used to create the structure of the page while <span>css</span> is used to style the page by: <span>adding colors</span>, <span>changing fonts</span>, <span>changing border sizes</span>, and much more! <span>css</span> is a language that will be covered more in depth in the <span>css section</span> but it will be utilized in small amounts in this section! The main thing to know now is that <span>css</span> can be added into an <span>html</span> file either <span>directly</span> or through <span>a link</span>. </p>
          <pre class="text-align-left">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
  &lt;html&gt;

    &lt;head&gt;
     &lt;title&gt; This is the title of the document! &lt;/title&gt;
     &lt;style&gt;

          html {
            color:red;
          }

      &lt;/style&gt;

      &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="sample.css"&gt;

    &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    (content of the body)
  &lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
      <p> As you can see, a <span>&lt;style&gt;</span> tag is used to add <span>css</span> directly into the html to change the color of text in the document to red. A <span>&lt;link&gt;</span> can be used to associate a <span>css</span> page to the <span>html</span> document. The <span>href</span> attribute is used to designate the relative location of the <span>css</span> file. The <span>rel</span>="stylesheet" attribute confirms that the <span>&lt;link&gt;</span> recognizes the document as a styling reference. The red color code can be added to the <span>css</span> page to affect this html document in the same way! </p>
      <p> You may have notices the <span>&lt;title&gt;</span> tag in the <span>&lt;head&gt;</span> section! This tag gives a title to the document that is used by search engines and the favorites tab of a web browser to identify this page.</p> 
          <h2>The Body</h2>
          <p> The <span>&lt;body&gt;</span> is where all the content of the webpage is displayed.</p>
          <p>The <span>&lt;body&gt;</span> is typically sectioned into <span>&lt;header&gt;</span>, <span>&lt;footer&gt;</span>, and the rest of the content. The <span>&lt;header&gt;</span> and <span>&lt;footer&gt;</span> usually display content that is identical to all webpages in the website. The <span>&lt;header&gt;</span> will have the website title, some navigation links, and maybe a small description. The <span>&lt;footer&gt;</span> typically has company contact information, copyright information, and other navigation elements. The following example is the <span>html</span> code for the <span>&lt;header&gt;</span> and the <span>&lt;footer&gt;</span> of this page!</p>
<pre class="text-align-left">
&lt;body&gt;

          &lt;a href="../../Navigation-Pages/Resume-Page/Resume.html"&gt;&lt;img class= "FPic2" src="../../Index-Resources/resume.jpg" alt="Link to Resume" title="Resume"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

      &lt;hr class="hr-dash"&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;
    Rest of the Document!
    &lt;footer&gt;

    &lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;



          </pre>
          <p>The rest of the <span>&lt;body&gt;</span> is typically divided into <span>&lt;section&gt;</span> (s) and other markups to organize the page. It is important to section and label portions of the page with the appropriate tags so that people can read the code, search engines can locate information easily, and people who use auditory aids can understand the webpage properly!  </p>
          <p>Finally, a <span>&lt;main&gt;</span> tag is used to display where the main content of the page is. This content includes parts of the page that are unique only to the webpage. For example: A webpage with a news story will have the <span>&lt;main&gt;</span> tag around the content of the news article.</p>
          <pre class="text-align-left">

          <h1> Paragraphs/Ordered Lists/Unordered Lists/Descriptive List</h1>
          <p>Paragraphs are lines of text that are separated/spaced out to provide a paragraph. Ordered lists and unordered lists display content in a list format. Unordered will display dots by default and an ordered list will display ordered numbers. A descriptive list gives titles and content for each title in a list format.</p>

          <p>A &lt;class&gt; is added to a markup/tag to designate style/css to be added to that line of content. The style changes to a partiuclar &lt;class&gt; can be found in the css stylesheet attached to the html document. The stylesheet link can be found in the &lt;head&gt; section.</p>
          <p>An &lt;img&gt; tag is used to add an image to the webpage. An image can have three attributes: the &lt;src&gt; atttribute adds the link to the image source; the &lt;alt&gt; attribute adds text information used to label the image in the html and when the image source is compromised; and the &lt;title&gt; attribute, which is displays a text description of the image if a cursor hovers over the image.</p>

            <h1>Aside Practice!
            </h1>
            <p> This sections uses the &lt;aside&gt; markup! The &lt;aside&gt; is for resources that may be related to the content on the page but is simply just an extra resource or additional related information. An example of this is an external resource related to a topic like an interesting biochemical reaction in a textbook that is being researched but is not the main focus of the textbook section. This type of &lt;aside&gt; is specifically external to another section.</p>

              <h1>Links/Navigation</h1>
                <p>The &lt;a&gt; tag is used to create a hyper link of the content it wraps. The &lt;a&gt; is called an anchor. It uses the &lt;href&gt; attribute to specify the path to the new webpage or section the current webpage. The &lt;target&gt; attribute of the anchor tag can designate where the link is opened in a separate tab.   </p>
                <p> This section has a &lt;nav&gt; navigation designation! Navigation is used to designate locations where multiple links to other websites are listed such as contact info. Mostly organizational purposes. <br> A url can be used for a link. The directory can be used to direct from the current folder to the webpage being linked to. The root directory is similar to the directory, except the beginning of the path starts with the root folder and moves down. <br> There is also an example of navigation within a webpage in the navigation links at the top of this page! <br> You can also link to a specific section of another page! I'll put an example in a comment on the html! <br> There is a &lt;mailto:&gt; command that can be added to an &lt;href&gt; attribute to send an email. An example of this and its formatting is given!</p>

              <p> &lt;Div&gt; is used to portion sections that are not clearly labeled into a defined section. This is good for extra content such as a random button for music like on this page haha. &lt;div&gt; is also used to encase the inside of the &lt;body&gt; section which helps with formatting in css, this is more of convention than a rule. &lt;main&gt; wraps the main portion of the webpage. This excludes the footer and header. This also excludes any content that can be percieved as extra such as an external &lt;aside&gt;. The &lt;blockquote&gt; is for large quotes or lists of quotes. </p>

           <h1>Address/break/Strong Tag/Small Tag</h1>
           <p>This section has an &lt;address&gt; tag for putting a geographical address. The information in the &lt;address&gt; tag is formatted in italics and can be found in a search as an address! The &lt;strong&gt; tag is used to indicate strong importance or urgency. The &lt;strong&gt; element is default bold. A &lt;br&gt; tag is a break. The break places information in separate lines for the same text section. The &lt;small&gt; tag is used for disclaimers, caveots, legal restrictions, and copyright information.</p>

            <h1>Horizontal Rule/Emphisis</h1>
            <p>An &lt;hr&gt; tag is used to separate different blocks of content inside of a &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, etc. This separatation is made for thematic breaks and subject (concept) changes. &lt;em&gt; (emphisis tags) add emphisis to particular words to change the meaning of the sentance. I have been using them to note the different types of tags but they are typically used like the below example. Emphasis is displayed as italics!</p>
            <p> An example of these concepts:</p>
            <hr class="example-divider">
            <p>The first rule of Fight Club is: You &lt;do not&gt; talk about Fight Club. I don't think I have to explain why this rule is so important!</p>
            <hr>
            <p>The second rule of Fight Club is: &lt;Always&gt; bring cupcakes. &lt;always bring cupcakes.&gt;</p>

            <h1>span/div/pre</h1>
            <p>&lt;span&gt; and &lt;div&gt; are markup tags that place non-specific labels on blocks of text. The labels can later be edited in css. &lt;span&gt; is used inside a block of content (such as a word or phrase in a sentence), while &lt;div&gt; is used for an entire block of content (an entire paragraph is surrounded by dev). css will be used to show where the &lt;div & span&gt; tags are. <br> &lt;pre&gt; is a markup tag that displays text & spacing exactly as it appears in the content. <br> There is a list of codes that can be used to add symbols that are commonly used in html structure such as &lt; the carrot. An example of a few of these are in the &lt;pre&gt; example. A full list of these codes are available in the coding resources webpage!</p>
            <p> The example for these concepts:</p>
            <hr class="example-divider">
            <div class="example-color"><p>One two three four five six seven eight nine ten. This entire block of text is surrounded by a div tag.</p></div>
            <p>One <span class="example-color">two</span> three four <span class="example-color">five</span> six seven eight nine ten. Certain words are wrapped by a span tag.</p>
            <pre>
              &lt;div&gt;
                This is a div...
                &lt;p&gt;This paragraph is nested&lt;/p&gt;

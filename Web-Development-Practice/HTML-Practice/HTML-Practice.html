           <p>html stands for hypertext markup language. The hyper text refers to the hyperlinks that can be created to link different webpages. The markup section refers to the various tags used throughout the language. A typical line will have a format of <em>markup + attributes</em> Content of line <em>/markup</em>. The line will have the markup tag opening and closing; attributes inside the tag to refer to links, image sources, css(styling); and the content referring to text of the line for the most part. </p>
           <p>I use italics to discuss attributes and markup tags, but just look at the html for the real format!</p>
           <p>To understand this page, its important to look at the source code of this page while reading. Right click the page and click view source code. To find the right section, use ctrl f and type in the section! </p>

          <h1>Webpage Structure</h1>
          <h2>General Page Layout</h2>
          <p>To begin a webpage a <em>!DOCTYPE html</em> is written to specify the html type of the page. The page is then wrapped in an <em>html</em> tag to display where the html content is.</p>
          <p>The webpage is sectioned into the <em>head</em> and the <em>body</em>. </p> 
          <h2>The head</h2>
          <p>The <em>head</em> contains information that the webpage uses and references such as css files for style and script for java. The title is added in the <em>head</em> for the page name in favorites/bookmarks. There are also different formatting options usable in the head section. </p> 
          <h2>The Body</h2>
          <p> The <em>body</em> is where all the content of the webpage is displayed.</p>
          <p>The <em>body</em> is typically sectioned into <em>header</em>, <em>footer</em>, and the rest of the content. The <em>header</em> and <em>footer</em> usually display content that is identical to all webpages in the website. The <em>header</em> will have the website title, some navigation links, and maybe a small description. The <em>footer</em> typically has company contact information, copyright information, and other navigation elements.</p>
          <p>The rest of the <em>body</em> is typically divided into <em>section</em> (s) and other markups to organize the page. It is important to section and label portions of the page with the appropriate tags so that people can read the code, search engines can locate information easily, and people who use auditory aids can understand the webpage properly!  </p>
          <p>Finally, a <em>main</em> tag is used to display where the main content of the page is. This content is usually parts of the page that are unique only to it, like a page that displays an article. The article is the <em>main</em> content.  </p>
          <hr class="example-divider">
          <h2>Example of this html</h2>
          <p>The html from the <a href="../../Sample-Page/Sample.html"> Sample-Page</a> displays these ideas pretty well. Just follow the link, right click the page, and view the page source! The information is also on this page, but it's probably better to look at a simpler webpage first!</p>

        <section>
          <h1> Paragraphs/Ordered Lists/Unordered Lists/Descriptive List</h1>
          <p>Paragraphs are lines of text that are separated/spaced out to provide a paragraph. Ordered lists and unordered lists display content in a list format. Unordered will display dots by default and an ordered list will display ordered numbers. A descriptive list gives titles and content for each title in a list format.</p>
          <p> An example of these concepts:</p>
              <hr class="example-divider"> 
              <p class=list-fix> This is the first paragraph of this webpage.</p>
              <p class=list-fix> This is the second paragraph of this webpage.</p>
              <p class=list-fix> This is the third paragraph of this webpage.</p>
      <!-- Ordered List That Contains Numbers-->
            <ol class=list-fix>
              <li> This is the first element of an ordered list!</li>
              <li> This is the second element of an ordered list!</li>
              <li>
                <ol>
                  <li>This is the first element of an ordered list! This is nested inside the overall list.</li>
                  <li>This is the second element of an ordered list! This is nested inside the overall list.</li>
                  <li>This is the third element of an ordered list! This is nested inside the overall list.</li>
                </ol></li>
            </ol>
      <!-- Unordered list that does not contain numbers-->
            <ul class=list-fix>
              <li> This is the first element of an unordered list!</li>
              <li> This is the second element of an unordered list!</li>
              <li>
                <ul>
                  <li>This is the first element of an unordered list! This is nested inside the overall list.</li>
                  <li>This is the second element of an unordered list! This is nested inside the overall list.</li>
                  <li>This is the third element of an unordered list! This is nested inside the overall list.</li>
                </ul></li>
            </ul>
      <!-- Descriptive List with titles and description-->
              <dl class=list-fix>
              <dt>Animal Cell</dt>
              <dd>Eukaryotic Cell without a cell wall.</dd>

          <h1>Classes/Images</h1>
          <p>A <em>class</em> is added to a markup/tag to designate style/css to be added to that line of content. The style changes to a partiuclar <em>class</em> can be found in the css stylesheet attached to the html document. The stylesheet can be found in the <em>head</em> section.</p>
          <p>An <em>img</em> tag (Image) is used to add an image to the webpage. An image can have three attributes: the <em>src</em> atttribute adds the link to the image source; the <em>alt</em> attribute adds text information used to label the image in the html and when the image source is compromised; and the <em>title</em> attribute, which is displays a text description of the image if a cursor hovers over the image.</p>
          <p> An example of these concepts:</p>
          <hr class="example-divider">
          <img class=" FPic4 example-image-format" src="HTML-Practice-Resources/trav.jfif" alt="Image of Travis Scott Concert" title="Image with Border added by Class">

        <h1>Article Practice!</h1>
             <p>This section uses an <em>article</em>> tag! An <em>article</em> is standalone content with a title and body. Think of a typical text section in a webpage. <em>article</em> (s) typically contain a header (<em>h1 h2 h3 etc</em> and a paragraph. There can be more section for longer <em>article</em> (s) An internal <em>aside</em> can be added to show a pulled quote from the <em>article</em>. 
             </p>
            <p>The <em>footer</em> at the end gives credits and additional information. A <em>header</em> and a <em>footer</em> can also be applied to an <em>article</em> just like the <em>body</em> </p>
            <p> An example of these concepts:</p>

           </header>
              <p>A human is made up of several organ systems. In order to maintain a stable environment inside the body, many of these organ systems need to work together.</p>
           <!-- This is an internal asside -->

            <h1>Aside Practice!
            </h1>
            <p> This sections uses the <em>aside</em> markup! The <em>aside</em> is for resources that may be related to the content on the page but is simply just an extra resource or additional related information. An example of this is an external resource related to a topic like an interesting biochemical reaction in a textbook that is being researched but is not the main focus of the textbook section. This type of <em>aside</em> is specifically external to another section.</p>
            <p> An example of these concepts:</p>
              <hr class="example-divider">
          <aside>
            <h2>References and Potential Helpful Articles
            </h2>
            <p>This is a textbook on human anatomy that can be helpful. Here is the link: https://openstax.org/details/books/anatomy-and-physiology</p>

              <h1>Links/Navigation</h1>
                <p>The <em>a</em> tag is used to create a hyper link of the content it wraps. The <em>a</em> is called an anchor. It uses the <em>href</em> attribute to specify the path to the new webpage or section the current webpage. The <em>target</em> attribute of the anchor tag can designate where the link is opened in a separate tab.   </p>
                <p> This section has a <em>nav</em> navigation designation! Navigation is used to designate locations where multiple links to other websites are listed such as contact info. Mostly organizational purposes.</p>
                <p> An example of these concepts:</p>
                <hr class="example-divider">
                <nav>
                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3egXqihisFQ">This is a special link that redirects to another page!</a></p>

            <h1>
              Div/Main/Block Quote
            </h1>
              <p> <em>Div</em> is used to portion sections that are not clearly labeled into a defined section. This is good for extra content such as a random button for music like on this page haha. <em>div</em> is also used to encase the inside of the <em>body</em> section which helps with formatting in css, this is more of convention than a rule. <em>main</em> wraps the main portion of the webpage. This excludes the footer and header. This also excludes any content that can be percieved as extra such as an external <em>aside</em>. The <em>blockquote</em> is for large quotes or lists of quotes. </p>
                <p> An example of these concepts:</p>

           <h1>Address/break/Strong Tag/Small Tag</h1>
           <p>This section has an <em>address</em> tag for putting a geographical address. The information in the <em>address</em> tag is formatted in italics and can be found in a search as an address! The <em>strong</em> tag is used to indicate strong importance or urgency. The <em>strong</em> element is default bold. A <em>br</em> tag is a break. The break places information in separate lines for the same text section. The <em>small</em> tag is used for disclaimers, caveots, legal restrictions, and copyright information.</p>

            <h1>Horizontal Rule/Emphisis</h1>
            <p>An <em>hr</em> tag is used to separate different blocks of content inside of a <em>section</em>, <em>article</em>, etc. This separatation is made for thematic breaks and subject (concept) changes. <em>em</em> (emphisis tags) add emphisis to particular words to change the meaning of the sentance. I have been using them to note the different types of tags but they are typically used like the below example. Emphasis is displayed as italics!</p>
            <p> An example of these concepts:</p>
            <hr class="example-divider">
            <p>The first rule of Fight Club is: You <em>do not</em> talk about Fight Club. I don't think i have to explain why this rule is so important!</p>

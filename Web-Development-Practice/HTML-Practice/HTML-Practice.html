           <p><span>html</span> stands for hypertext markup language. The hypertext refers to the hyperlinks that can be created to link different webpages. The markup section refers to the various tags used throughout the language.</p>
             <p> An example of a markup tag could be the simple &lt;p&gt; (<span>paragraph</span>) markup tag.</p>
            <pre>&lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
            <p>All markup tags follow the format of the <span>opening-tag:</span> &lt;p&gt; <span>content:</span> Hello World <span>closing-tag:</span> &lt;/p&gt;</p>
            <p><span>Attributes</span> are added to a tag to give it a particular property.</p>
            <p>An &lt;a&gt;(anchor) tag is used to create a link from text. The attribute href="" is added to specify the source of the link!</p>

          <h1>Webpage Structure</h1>
          <h2>General Page Layout</h2>
          <p><span>To begin a webpage</span> a &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; is written to specify the <span>html type</span> of the page. The page is then wrapped in an &lt;html&gt; tag to display where the html content is.</p>
          <pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
(Rest of document lol)
&lt;/html&gt;
          </pre>
          <p>The webpage is sectioned into the &lt;head&gt; and the &lt;body&gt;. </p> 
          <h2>The Head</h2>
          <p>The &lt;head&gt; contains information that the webpage uses and references such as css files for style and script for java. The title is added in the &lt;head&gt; for the page name in favorites/bookmarks. There are also different formatting options usable in the head section. </p> 
          <h2>The Body</h2>
          <p> The &lt;body&gt; is where all the content of the webpage is displayed.</p>
          <p>The &lt;body&gt; is typically sectioned into &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, and the rest of the content. The &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; usually display content that is identical to all webpages in the website. The &lt;header&gt; will have the website title, some navigation links, and maybe a small description. The &lt;footer&gt; typically has company contact information, copyright information, and other navigation elements.</p>
          <p>The rest of the &lt;body&gt; is typically divided into &lt;section&gt; (s) and other markups to organize the page. It is important to section and label portions of the page with the appropriate tags so that people can read the code, search engines can locate information easily, and people who use auditory aids can understand the webpage properly!  </p>
          <p>Finally, a &lt;main&gt; tag is used to display where the main content of the page is. This content is usually parts of the page that are unique only to it, like a page that displays an article. The article is the &lt;main&gt; content.  </p>
          <hr class="example-divider">
          <h2>Example of this html</h2>
          <p>The html from the <a href="../../Sample-Page/Sample.html"> Sample-Page</a> displays these ideas pretty well. Just follow the link, right click the page, and view the page source! The information is also on this page, but it's probably better to look at a simpler webpage first!</p>

        <section id="paragraph-list">
          <h1> Paragraphs/Ordered Lists/Unordered Lists/Descriptive List</h1>
          <p>Paragraphs are lines of text that are separated/spaced out to provide a paragraph. Ordered lists and unordered lists display content in a list format. Unordered will display dots by default and an ordered list will display ordered numbers. A descriptive list gives titles and content for each title in a list format.</p>
          <p> An example of these concepts:</p>

              <p class=list-fix> This is the second paragraph of this webpage.</p>

                  <li>This is the first element of an ordered list! This is nested inside the overall list.</li>
                  <li>This is the second element of an ordered list! This is nested inside the overall list.</li>
                  <li>This is the third element of an ordered list! This is nested inside the overall list.</li>
                </ol></li>

      <!-- Unordered list that does not contain numbers-->
            <ul class=list-fix>

          <h1>Classes/Images</h1>
          <p>A &lt;class&gt; is added to a markup/tag to designate style/css to be added to that line of content. The style changes to a partiuclar &lt;class&gt; can be found in the css stylesheet attached to the html document. The stylesheet link can be found in the &lt;head&gt; section.</p>
          <p>An &lt;img&gt; tag is used to add an image to the webpage. An image can have three attributes: the &lt;src&gt; atttribute adds the link to the image source; the &lt;alt&gt; attribute adds text information used to label the image in the html and when the image source is compromised; and the &lt;title&gt; attribute, which is displays a text description of the image if a cursor hovers over the image.</p>

Think of a typical text section in a webpage. &lt;article&gt; (s) typically contain a header (&lt;h1&gt;,&lt;h2&gt;,&lt;h3&gt; etc) and a paragraph. An internal &lt;aside&gt; can be added to show a pulled quote from the &lt;article&gt;. 
             </p>
            <p>The &lt;footer&gt; at the end gives credits and additional information. A &lt;header&gt; and a &lt;footer&gt; can also be applied to an &lt;article&gt; just like the &lt;body&gt; </p>

            <h1>Aside Practice!

            <p> This sections uses the &lt;aside&gt; markup! The &lt;aside&gt; is for resources that may be related to the content on the page but is simply just an extra resource or additional related information. An example of this is an external resource related to a topic like an interesting biochemical reaction in a textbook that is being researched but is not the main focus of the textbook section. This type of &lt;aside&gt; is specifically external to another section.</p>

              <h1>Links/Navigation</h1>
                <p>The &lt;a&gt; tag is used to create a hyper link of the content it wraps. The &lt;a&gt; is called an anchor. It uses the &lt;href&gt; attribute to specify the path to the new webpage or section the current webpage. The &lt;target&gt; attribute of the anchor tag can designate where the link is opened in a separate tab.   </p>
                <p> This section has a &lt;nav&gt; navigation designation! Navigation is used to designate locations where multiple links to other websites are listed such as contact info. Mostly organizational purposes. <br> A url can be used for a link. The directory can be used to direct from the current folder to the webpage being linked to. The root directory is similar to the directory, except the beginning of the path starts with the root folder and moves down. <br> There is also an example of navigation within a webpage in the navigation links at the top of this page! <br> You can also link to a specific section of another page! I'll put an example in a comment on the html! <br> There is a &lt;mailto:&gt; command that can be added to an &lt;href&gt; attribute to send an email. An example of this and its formatting is given!</p>

              <p> &lt;Div&gt; is used to portion sections that are not clearly labeled into a defined section. This is good for extra content such as a random button for music like on this page haha. &lt;div&gt; is also used to encase the inside of the &lt;body&gt; section which helps with formatting in css, this is more of convention than a rule. &lt;main&gt; wraps the main portion of the webpage. This excludes the footer and header. This also excludes any content that can be percieved as extra such as an external &lt;aside&gt;. The &lt;blockquote&gt; is for large quotes or lists of quotes. </p>

            <p>An &lt;hr&gt; tag is used to separate different blocks of content inside of a &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, etc. This separatation is made for thematic breaks and subject (concept) changes. &lt;em&gt; (emphisis tags) add emphisis to particular words to change the meaning of the sentance.

            <p>&lt;span&gt; and &lt;div&gt; are markup tags that place non-specific labels on blocks of text. The labels can later be edited in css. &lt;span&gt; is used inside a block of content (such as a word or phrase in a sentence), while &lt;div&gt; is used for an entire block of content (an entire paragraph is surrounded by dev). css will be used to show where the &lt;div & span&gt; tags are. <br> &lt;pre&gt; is a markup tag that displays text & spacing exactly as it appears in the content. <br> There is a list of codes that can be used to add symbols that are commonly used in html structure such as &lt; the carrot. An example of a few of these are in the &lt;pre&gt; example. A full list of these codes are available in the coding resources webpage!</p>

        <h2>The Struggle For National Reconstruction</h2>
            <p></p>
            <h3>Presidential Approaches: From Lincoln to Lincoln</h3>
              <p>Lincoln offered  amnesty to Confederates and allowed rebel states to return as long as 10 percent of voters swear loyalty, approve thirteenth amendment, and abolish slavery. The confederates rejected this &lt;Ten Percent Plan&gt;. In 1864, Congress proposed the &lt;Wade-Davis Bill&gt; which required an oath of allegiance for majority of of the state's white men, forms government from parts of states that did not fight, and completely remove Confederate leaders. Lincoln used a pocket veto to leave the bill unsigned. <br> Lincoln dies in 1865. Americans are mourning. North blames south for murderer. Country is left with Andrew Jackson (Less moral sense and political judgement). Lincoln added Andrew Jackson as vice president during the war. Jackson was a Democrat. Johnson would disagree with Rebluicans during his time in office. Johnson allowed ex-confederates to take office and they ex-confederates created &lt;Black Codes&gt;. The &lt;Black Codes&gt; reflected plantation owners' interests. Severe penalties on black people who did not fulfill full year labor contracts. Back children are taken from parents and apprenticed to former slaves masters. <br> Johnson had previous rhetoric that he wanted to be tough on southern plantation owners, but he does the opposite. He helps many ex-confederates get back into office and Unionists are angry.                                                                                                                                                             </p>
